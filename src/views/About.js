      Papillon Cafe is a proudly independent takeaway coffee stop located on Dublin’s vibrant Parnell Street. 
      Founded in late 2024 by two friends from Croatia, Papillon was born out of a love for quality coffee, 
      personal connection, and the dream of building something of their own in Ireland.<br></br><br></br>
