    description="Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat 
        from nuclear fusion reactions. In a fusion process, two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a 
        heavier nucleus, while releasing energy. Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion 
        reactors. Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s, but as of 2024, no device has reached net 
        power, although net positive reactions have been achieved.
         <br></br>
        Fusion processes require fuel, in a state of plasma, and a confined environment with sufficient temperature, 
        pressure, and confinement time. The combination of these parameters that results in a power-producing system 
        is known as the Lawson criterion. In stellar cores the most common fuel is the lightest isotope of hydrogen 
        (protium), and gravity provides the conditions needed for fusion energy production. Proposed fusion reactors 
        would use the heavy hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium for DT fusion, for which the Lawson criterion 
        is known to be easiest to achieve. This produces a helium nucleus and an energetic neutron. Most designs 
        aim to heat their fuel to around 100 million kelvins, which presents a major challenge in producing a 
        successful design. Fusion fuel is 10 million times more energy dense than coal, but tritium is extremely 
        rare on Earth, having a half life of only ~12.3 years. Consequently, during the operation of envisioned fusion 
        reactors, breeding blankets are subjected to neutron fluxes to generate tritium to complete the fuel cycle.
         <br></br>
        As a source of power, nuclear fusion has a number of potential advantages compared to fission. These include 
        little high-level waste, and increased safety. However, the necessary combination of temperature, pressure, 
        and duration has proven to be difficult to produce in a practical and economical manner. A second issue that 
        affects common reactions is managing resulting neutron radiation, which over time degrade the reaction 
        chamber, especially the first wall.
