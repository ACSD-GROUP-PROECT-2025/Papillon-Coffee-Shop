    description="Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work. Historically, wind power was used by 
        sails, windmills and windpumps, but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. This article 
        deals only with wind power for electricity generation. Today, wind power is generated almost 
        completely with wind turbines, generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid.
         <br></br>
        In 2022, wind supplied over 2,304 TWh of electricity, which was 7.8% of world electricity. With about 100 GW 
        added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW.
        32 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from wind power in 2023 and wind generation has 
        nearly tripled since 2015. To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, analysts say it 
        should expand much faster – by over 1% of electricity generation per year.
         <br></br>
        Wind power is considered a sustainable, renewable energy source, and has a much smaller impact on the 
        environment compared to burning fossil fuels. Wind power is variable, so it needs energy storage or other 
        dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity. Land-based (onshore) wind 
        farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced. Wind 
        farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors, although they are generally 
        more expensive. Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations.
         <br></br>
        Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced. In many locations, new 
        onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants.
         <br></br>
        Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power. In most 
        regions, wind power generation is higher in nighttime, and in winter when solar power output is low. For this 
        reason, combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries.
