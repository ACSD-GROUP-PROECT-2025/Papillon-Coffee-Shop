        Guatemala is renowned for its high-quality coffee, grown in its rich volcanic soil and unique microclimates. 
        Coffee production in the country is primarily done on small farms, ensuring careful cultivation and harvesting.
        The beans are typically grown at high altitudes, which results in a rich, complex flavor profile with chocolatey and fruity notes.
