            Guatemala is one of the worldâ€™s most renowned coffee-growing countries, known for its distinct coffee regions 
            like Antigua, Huehuetenango, and CobÃ¡n. Each area produces beans with unique flavor profilesâ€”ranging from sweet 
            cocoa and spice notes to bright citrus and floral aromas. The coffee is typically grown at altitudes over 1,500 meters, 
            contributing to the complexity in cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Farmers in Guatemala rely on traditional methods of cultivation and often process the beans using the 
            <strong> wet method</strong>, which involves fermenting and washing the beans to enhance their clarity and brightness. 
            This careful post-harvest handling ensures a refined and clean flavor.

            Coffee production plays a vital economic and cultural role in Guatemala. It supports hundreds of thousands of farmers, 
            many of whom are part of cooperatives focused on sustainability and fair trade practices. Coffee exports are a major 
            driver of the national economy and a symbol of pride for many communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specialty-grade Guatemalan beans are often found in premium coffee shops and roasters around the worldâ€”like 
            <strong> Two Fifty Square</strong> in Dublin.
