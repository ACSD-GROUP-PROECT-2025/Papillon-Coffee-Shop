      description="Solar power, also known as solar electricity, is the conversion of energy from sunlight into 
        electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV) or indirectly using concentrated solar power. 
        Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current. Concentrated solar 
        power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a 
        hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.
        <br></br>
        Photovoltaics (PV) were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized 
        applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an 
        off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 
        1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar panels has fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems' capacity 
        and production has doubled about every three years. Three-quarters of new generation capacity is 
        solar, with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations 
        continuing to be built.
        <br></br>
        In 2023, solar power generated 5.5% (1,631 TWh) of global electricity and over 1% of primary energy, adding 
        twice as much new electricity as coal. Along with onshore wind power, utility-scale solar is the 
        source with the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries. As of 
        2023, 33 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from solar, with China making up 
        more than half of solar growth. Almost half the solar power installed in 2022 was mounted on rooftops.
        <br></br>
        Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change. The International
        Energy Agency said in 2022 that more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of 
        policy, regulation and financing challenges. Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy.
